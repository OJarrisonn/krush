# krush

Krush is a remake of a project of mine called [diysh](https://www.github.com/OJarrisonn/diysh). The reason i created ```krush``` is because I hate the way ```diysh``` project evolved. Actually it was my first Rust project ever. The aim of ```krush``` is to be splitted into parts: ```krush``` (the shell interface), [```krush-engine```](https://www.github.com/OJarrisonn/krush-engine) (the command interpreter) and ```krush-log``` (the logging system).
